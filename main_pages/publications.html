            <h1>PUBLICATIONS</h1>
            <p>Documentation and publications unrelated to the content of any legislation or other official papers. Also documentation related to the use and development of this site.</p>

            <p>Due to the complex nature and exact format of jurisdiction in Stutzland, drafting certain documents can be difficult. A few guides and templates have been provided here to facilitate efficient legislation.</p>

            <h2>Current state of politics</h2>
            <p>Main issues</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Foreign policy. Should Stutzland continue aggressive foreign policy backed by WA, or pursue peaceful diplomatics with Pan-Slavia? Is the economic race with NAU a greater threat than military escalation in the East?</li>
                <li>Welfare state. Should federal retirement pension be based on all past earnings or just a proportion? Should unemployment be fought with more social support, or cuts to unemployment compensations?</li>
                <li>Military spending. Is the current state of military spending (over 10%) sustainable, or should some acquisitons be delayed?</li>
                <li>State autonomy. Can State parliaments be allowed to issue their own effective legislation, or should legislative power be centralised to Bundesvertretung?</li>
                <li>Size of administration. Is one extra minister or ministry sustainable, or should administration be brought down in favour of savings and simplicity?</li>
                <li>Environmental issues. Is the development and acquisition of nuclear weapons justified, or should appropriations be directed toward environmental conservation and nuclear energy production?</li>
                <li>Religious issues. Can religion be tought in public schools, or should it be strictly separate from public life? Can the Federation fund churches and other religious organisations?</li>
                <li>National security. Is the <i>de facto</i> independency of BASED (Bundesamt f√ºr Statssicherheit und Einsatzdienste) justified, or should it be more strictly under parliamentary supervision and control?</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>Socialist People's Party (SPP) has for long taken a leftist stance on social and financial issues. The party is a staunch supporter of the welfare state and wants public spending to be expanded to cover more pensions, social compensations, and public healthcare, at the cost of increased taxes. On social issues, the party is more neutral, but it supports stronger parliamentarism than at the momement exists. SPP does not support federal funding of churches, and silently supports the <i>status quo</i> of foreign politics, aka expansionism and economic control over Europe.</p>
            <p>Green Action League (GAL) is the leading left leaning liberal party, that has for long called for nuclear weapons ban. It has also demanded for the enactment of a law that would define allowed amount of use of fossil fuels for electricity production. GAL is also against federal funding of churches and wants BASED under the control of Bundesvertretung. On the part of welfare state, GAL is not strictly against or in support of it. GAL also opposes aggressive foreign politics.</p>
            <p>Christian Social Platform (CSP) is the odd one among all parties. It shares similar views with SPP on social and financial issues, calling for increased spending to support those from poorer households. The party is backed and financed by lutheran churches and holds conservative views on social and identity related issues. CSP supports more aggressive foreign politics, especially against orthodox Pan-Slavia.</p>
            <p>Private Reform Party (PRP) was originally founded as a platform to support bringing down the welfare state, but has since then grown into an intellectual liberal party, that simply wants lower taxes and peaceful, trade interested foreign politics. PRP has for long partnered with NCA, which shares similar financial views. PRP's long term goal is to privatise public healthcare and Reichsbank.</p>
            <p>National Assembly (NAS) is the oldest party in Stutzland. Originally a monarchist party that supported the Kaiser in all matters, NAS has turned into an ideologically conservative, financially liberal party, during the republic era of the past over fifty years. With SPP as its arch enemy, NAS is against the welfare state and social spending. While not as radical in its privatisation goals as PRP is, NAS still supports lower taxes and large scale privatisation of federal owned companies. NAS also supports the foreign policy status quo.</p>
            <p>Heimatspartei (HP) is a more recent party, founded just twenty years ago. Originally a sub-division of NAS, Heimatspartei has grown into a radical and authoritarian organisation. It is not strictly against welfare state, but critizises unemployment compensations and high taxes. HP also pursues aggressive foreign policy and accuses Pan-Slavia and NAU of Stutzland's problems. HP also wants more administration and supports the idea of an executive and powerful president.</p>

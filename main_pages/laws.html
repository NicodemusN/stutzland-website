            <h1>LEGISLATION</h1>
            <p>All published laws, federal and state specific. More will be added as writing process continues.</p>
            <h2>Reading guide</h2>
            <p>Federal laws can vary in structure for historical and contextual reasons. In general, laws are divided into sections (ยง). For clarity, laws are usually also divided in chapters, but sections are enumerated together as one list and not according to their position in chapters. For this reason, a third chapter in a law begins with ยง 15 in stead of ยง 1.</p>
            <p>Verfassung (the constitution) is a special law that is divided into articles within chapters due to its comprehensive and extensive nature.</p>
            <p>Sections are divided into subsections, aka paragraphs. It is preferred to call them paragraphs, but both terms are used. For example, the following section has three paragraphs:</p>
            <div>
                <h3 style="color:royalblue">13 &sect; - Board proposals</h3>

                <p style="color:royalblue">The board of an association shall have the decide which affairs are to be voted on in meetings. However, all members of the association must be granted the chance to speak in meetings and thus propose matters, that they deem important for the association.</p>

                <p style="color:royalblue">The board shall have the right to make official proposals that can be turned into binding policies of the association.</p>

                <p style="color:royalblue">The process of discussing affairs in meetings can be defined further in the charter or another relevant binding document.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Paragraphs can further be divided into subparagraphs, especially concerning lists. If a paragraph contains a list of different items, each row or item of the list can be referred to as a subparagraphs. They are also enumerated when referring to them, but they are not enumerated in the law itself.</p>
            <p>There are a few abbreviations used in laws, that refer to certain organisations. Following list applies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>FeB</b>: Federal parliament bill. Most common bills are law proposals. Not used for amending law proposals from the Federal Government.</li>
                <li><b>GoP</b>: Government Proposal. A law proposal from the Federal Government. In laws they are used to signify, that a piece of the law in question has been changed with a governmental law proposal, that has been passed by the Federal Parliament.</li>
            </ul>

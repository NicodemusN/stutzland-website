<!--l. 58--><p class="noindent" >A labour union shall be understood as an association, as defined in Association Act &#167; 1, of which primary objective is to
promote workers&#8217; rights and benefit. An <span 
class="ecti-1000">employer union </span>shall be understood similarly, but its primary objective is to
promote employers&#8217; rights and benefit.
<!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-2000"></a>2 &#167; - Collective agreements</h4>
<!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" >Labour and employer unions shall be granted the right to draft and enforce collective agreements, that are based on
Employment Law. These shall be binding to all workers and employers, regardless of membership in a union, within the
sector of trade or industry in which the agreements is meant to affect.
<!--l. 71--><p class="noindent" >Collective agreements must be made in writing, for three year periods at a time. Unions must notify the relevant ministry of
their members and the agreement that has been made.
<!--l. 75--><p class="noindent" >Collective agreements may overrule Employment Law in ways that improve workers&#8217; rights and benefits. The agreements
may not overrule Employment Law in ways that weaken its protective measures.
<!--l. 79--><p class="noindent" >If labour and employer unions together agree, a <span 
class="ecti-1000">general collective agreement </span>may be drafted and enforced. All unions must
be represented in its making and it shall be treated in the same way as a conventional collective agreement, except,
that it shall overrule anything that has been decided in a conventional collective agreement. There may be
only one general collective agreement at a time, it shall not be negotiated no more often than every five
years.
<!--l. 87--><p class="noindent" >

 id="x1-3000"></a>3 &#167; - Resignation</h4>
<!--l. 89--><p class="noindent" >Industry or trade specific unions may resign their collective agreements, if they agree to use the general collective agreement

<!--l. 93--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a>4 &#167; - Transition</h4>

agreement.

<!--l. 100--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a>5 &#167; - Disposition</h4>
<!--l. 102--><p class="noindent" >If an employment contract is against the collective agreement that it should correspond, shall the contract be nullified for
those parts that are against the agreement. If the contract becomes nullified as whole due to these circumstances, shall the
employer be obligated to offer the employee a new contract that corresponds that of the nullified contract, and complies
with the collective agreement.
<!--l. 109--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-6000"></a>6 &#167; - Penalty for an infringing contract</h4>
<!--l. 111--><p class="noindent" >If an employer and an employee, binded by a collective agreement, knowingly create an employment contract that is against
the agreement, shall they be penalised. The employer may be penalised with a fine up to 15 000 <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&#x20AC; </span>and the employee may be
penalised with a fine up to 150 <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&#x20AC;</span>.
<!--l. 117--><p class="noindent" >This penalty can be removed in a collective agreement, general or conventional.
<!--l. 120--><p class="noindent" >The penalty can be renewed until the infringing contract has been nullified or altered to comply with the collective
agreement that should be binding it.

class="tcrm-1000">&#x20AC;</span>.
<!--l. 130--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-8000"></a>8 &#167; - Bounden subjects</h4>
<!--l. 132--><p class="noindent" >Collective agreements bind all labour and employer unions, private employers, and employees, unless a condition
found in an agreement clearly infringes that of the existing legislation concerning employment and basic
rights.
<!--l. 137--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-9000"></a>9 &#167; - Premature nullification of an agreement</h4>
<!--l. 139--><p class="noindent" >A collective agreement may be one-sidedly nullified, if the agreement infringes the existing legislation or the general
collective agreement in a way that can be considered particularly serious and offending.
<!--l. 143--><p class="noindent" >A state-level court shall decide if the collective agreement can be nullified partly or totally. If the agreement is withheld in
force in its entirety, shall the party that originally nullified it pay a fine of 1000 <span 
class="tcrm-1000">&#x20AC;</span>. All parties of the agreement must
continue complying with it once its state has been decided.

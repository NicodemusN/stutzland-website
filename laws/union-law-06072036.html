            <h3 id="subsec1">1 &sect; - Unions</h3>

            <p>All workers shall have the right to join, leave, or establish a labour union, which shall have the right to represent its members in creating collective agreements. This right is manifested in Verfassung &sect; 12.</p>

            <p>A labour union shall be understood as an association, as defined in Association Act &sect; 1, of which primary objective is to promote workers' rights and benefit. An employer union shall be understood similarly, but its primary objective is to promote employers' rights and benefit.</p>

            <h3 id="subsec2">2 &sect; - Collective agreements</h3>

            <p>Labour and employer unions shall be granted the right to draft and enforce collective agreements, that are based on Employment Law. These shall be binding to all workers and employers, regardless of membership in a union, within the sector of trade or industry in which the agreements is meant to affect.</p>

            <p>Collective agreements must be made in writing, for three year periods at a time. Unions must notify the relevant ministry of their members and the agreement that has been made.</p>

            <p>Collective agreements may overrule Employment Law in ways that improve workers' rights and benefits. The agreements may not overrule Employment Law in ways that weaken its protective measures.</p>

            <p>If labour and employer unions together agree, a general collective agreement may be drafted and enforced. All unions must be represented in its making and it shall be treated in the same way as a conventional collective agreement, except, that it shall overrule anything that has been decided in a conventional collective agreement. There may be only one general collective agreement at a time, it shall not be negotiated no more often than every five years.</p>

            <h3 id="subsec3">3 &sect; - Resignation</h3>

            <p>Industry or trade specific unions may resign their collective agreements, if they agree to use the general collective agreement in their place as the primary set of rights and conditions for employment.</p>

            <h3 id="subsec4">4 &sect; - Transition</h3>

            <p>If a private organisation, such as a company, corporation, or another corresponding association, is sold or ceases to exist within the timeframe of a collective agreement, shall the following association be binded by the agreement.</p>

            <h3 id="subsec5">5 &sect; - Disposition</h3>

            <p>If an employment contract is against the collective agreement that it should correspond, shall the contract be nullified for those parts that are against the agreement. If the contract becomes nullified as whole due to these circumstances, shall the employer be obligated to offer the employee a new contract that corresponds that of the nullified contract, and complies with the collective agreement.</p>

            <h3 id="subsec6">6 &sect; - Penalty for an infringing contract</h3>

            <p>If an employer and an employee, binded by a collective agreement, knowingly create an employment contract that is against the agreement, shall they be penalised. The employer may be penalised with a fine up to 15 000 € and the employee may be penalised with a fine up to 150 €.</p>

            <p>This penalty can be removed in a collective agreement, general or conventional.</p>

            <p>The penalty can be renewed until the infringing contract has been nullified or altered to comply with the collective agreement that should be binding it.</p>

            <h3 id="subsec7">7 &sect; - Penalty for breaking an agreement</h3>

            <p>If a labour or employer union knowingly, or in a way that they should have acknowledged, breaks a collective agreement, shall they be penalised with a fine up to 30 000 €.</p>

            <h3 id="subsec8">8 &sect; - Bounden subjects</h3>

            <p>Collective agreements bind all labour and employer unions, private employers, and employees, unless a condition found in an agreement clearly infringes that of the existing legislation concerning employment and basic rights.</p>

            <h3 id="subsec9">9 &sect; - Premature nullification of an agreement</h3>

            <p>A collective agreement may be one-sidedly nullified, if the agreement infringes the existing legislation or the general collective agreement in a way that can be considered particularly serious and offending.</p>

            <p>A state-level court shall decide if the collective agreement can be nullified partly or totally. If the agreement is withheld in force in its entirety, shall the party that originally nullified it pay a fine of 1000 €. All parties of the agreement must continue complying with it once its state has been decided.</p>

            <h3 id="subsec10">10 &sect; - Display of rights and conditions</h3>

            <p>An employer, binded by a collective agreement, must have the effective agreement on display at the workplace for all employees to see.</p>

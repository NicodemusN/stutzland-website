            <h2 id="sec1">1 Basis of the law</h2>

            <h3>1 &sect; - Intentions</h3>

            <p>This law intents to provide funding for all federal administration. Federal funding is not limited to taxes. Taxes for both States and the Federation are collected together, and shared later appropriately according to what is decreed.</p>

            <p>Taxes shall be issued only according to what is decreed in this law. The purpose of Tax Law is to provide both funding to the federation, and protection from unjust financial exploitation to persons living or operating in Stutzland.</p>

            <h3>2 &sect; - Constitutional grounds</h3>

            <p>This law implements Verfassung &sect; 73, &sect; 74, and &sect; 75. The federal exclusive right to issue taxes shall be from the constitution and this law.</p>

            <p>If taxation, that infringes the constitution, occures, shall the Federation pay back all the taxable subjects that were wrongly taxed.</p>

            <h3>3 &sect; - Progressive taxation</h3>

            <p>This law, its derivatives, and directives derived from it, shall be based on the principle of progressive taxation, unless otherwise specifically stated.</p>

            <p>Progressive taxation implies, that the percentage of taxes paid shall increase in conjunction with the taxable subject's wealth. Besides, taxes must always be presented as percentages calculated from associated wealth, instead of fixed sums, except for minor instances when otherwise stated.</p>

            <h3>4 &sect; - Ministry of Finances</h3>
